This repository contains all code written as part of my Mathematics Bachelor End Project at the Eindhoven University of Technology. The report itself can be found in the main folder along with two subdirectories containing two parts of the program. The first one, `GraphCIS` contains code used in part A of the report and `GraphConnectivity` contains the code used in part B of the report.

The following Java libraries have been used:
*  [GraphStream](http://graphstream-project.org/)
*  [Apache Commons Math 3.6.1](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/)
*  [Jeigen](https://github.com/hughperkins/jeigen)
